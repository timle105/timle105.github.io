        I was born and raised in Mountain View, California. Growing up in the high tech capital Sillicon Valley, it influenced and inspired me to pursue a
        degree in computer science. Computer science has become a growing passion of mine and I'm aiming to emphasize in data science. Outside of computer science
        I love to play tennis. I have been playing for 10 years and played in both my middle school and highschool teams. A fun fact about me is that I have
        played Teamfight Tactics, a strategy game competitively. I have peaked top 50 in North America and even competed in one of the games inaugural 
        in person tournaments.
